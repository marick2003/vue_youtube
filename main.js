    describe: "Have you ever wanted to dynamically animate layouts without sacrificing performance? In this talk, innovative illusions will be revealed that will transform your static user interfaces into lively, intuitive experiences for your users at 60 frames per second. We'll investigate even the most complex animated layouts and discover how certain techniques, such as FLIP, containment, clever transforms, pseudoelements, CSS variables, and more can make layout animations easier and smoother."

    describe: "The new CSS Grid specification is here! Sure, it’s fun to play with, but is it truly ready or even practical to use for everyday work? As a designer and front end developer at a software development agency, I've been using CSS Grid in production websites since its initial release to browsers in March 2017 and I’m a huge fan. It is already making my life easier."

Heck, at 9% of the Australian population, there are more people with vision impairments visiting your site than Internet Explorer users. What tools and techniques are they using, and how will that affect your design?"

    describe: "Color is the most relative medium in art. This fact makes working with color in design systems particularly challenging. Few people seem to want to claim to be an expert in color—perhaps because there’s an immensely deep amount to learn, or perhaps it’s because color is one of those things we hate to get wrong. Whatever the reason, color remains a contentious but often critical part of design."

The power we've gotten to control the cache with Service Workers? That's but the first step of what Houdini will offer for render engines. "

Maybe something different has been built? Maybe it’s lacking overall polish (why isn’t that button 3px to the left?)?"

    describe: "As part of Origins, I have been researching the different paths of coders and designers into the tech industry, and the paths are wonderfully varied and unique. However, we continue to raise up and legitimise certain paths over others, implicitly deciding who gets to be a developer of CSS or Javascript. That language then feeds into job postings and wider perceptions of what it is to write CSS, what it is to write Javascript (or even Javascript frameworks), and the legitimacy of different learning paths. From this, we create hierarchies and draw lines which result in different pay scales and fluctuating perceptions of the code we write. This threatens to devalue inclusivity work, and the development community as a whole— let’s learn about the unconventional paths into development and consciously pull away from the damaging hierarchies we create. Let’s celebrate these journeys instead!"
